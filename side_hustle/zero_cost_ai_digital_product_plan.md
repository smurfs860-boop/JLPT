Use this to validate the full funnel end-to-end **without** announcing or launching publicly.

### Gumroad (Product + Lead Magnet)
- Create the paid product in **draft** mode.
- Create the lead magnet as a free product with **email collection on**.
- Use a test pricing value (e.g., $19) and confirm tax settings if applicable.

### Email Automation (MailerLite)
- Connect Gumroad to MailerLite (native or Zapier/Make).
- Trigger the sequence with a **test email** to ensure tags + automation fire.
- Verify the Day 0 email delivers the lead magnet and a working CTA link.

### Delivery + Access
- Use Gumroad’s preview link to ensure the PDF downloads correctly.
- Verify the lead magnet PDF opens properly on mobile + desktop.

### Checkout Flow
- Use Gumroad’s test mode (if available) or simulate checkout with a 100% off code.
- Confirm the buyer is added to the paid-product list/segment.

### Links + Tracking
- Click every CTA link (lead magnet → paid product).
- If using UTM tags, confirm they appear in the landing page URL.

### Content Scheduling
- Load 3 posts into Buffer (or equivalent) and confirm they schedule properly.
- Confirm your profile bios/link hub point to the lead magnet.

### Final Launch Gate
- Once all checks pass, switch the paid product from draft to live.
- Replace any “test” copy, pricing, or placeholder links.
